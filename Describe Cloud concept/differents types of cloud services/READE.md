# Describe Cloud Service Types  

Summary: Know the differences between IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.  

### Describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Cloud responsible for:
- hardware
- network
- physical security

Client responsible for:
- Everything else

Use-cases:
- Lift-and-shift: Moving from on-premises to data centers hosted by CSPs
- For quickly setting up testing or development environments

#### important point:
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
* Users can rent virtual servers, storage, networking, and other computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. With IaaS, organizations can scale their infrastructure up or down based on demand, reducing the need for physical hardware investment and maintenance. 
* This model offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and rapid deployment of IT resources compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

### Describe platform as a service (PaaS)
Cloud responsible for:
- same as IaaS and
- maintaining development environment infrastrucure (OS and DB updates and maintenance)

Use-cases:
- Create apps using built-in software components, reduce amount of code to write
- Built-in analytics and BI

1. Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. 
2. PaaS offerings typically include development tools, runtime environments, databases, and other services required to support the complete lifecycle of application development. This model enables developers to focus on writing code and deploying applications, accelerating the development process and reducing time-to-market.
3. PaaS offerings also provide scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness by abstracting the underlying infrastructure complexities.

### Describe software as a service (SaaS)
Renting a fully developed application.

Examples:
- Email and messaging
- Finance and expense tracking
- Business productivity apps

1. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where software applications are hosted and provided to users over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access these applications through web browsers without needing to install or manage any software locally.
2. SaaS eliminates the need for upfront software purchases, updates, and maintenance, offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness for businesses and individuals.
